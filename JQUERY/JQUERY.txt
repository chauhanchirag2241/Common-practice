jquery and ohter javascript frameworks
as you already know jquery uses the $ sign as a shortcut for jquery
there are many other popular javascript frameworks like angular , backbone, ember , knockout, and more 
what if other javascript frameworks also use the $sign as a shortcut

if two different frameworks are using the same shortcut.ont of them might stop working
the jqury team have already tought about this, and implement the noconflict() method.

the jquery noConflict method
the no conflict() method releases the hold on the $ shortcut identifier,so theat other scrpts can use it.
you can of cource still use jquery simpl by writeting ghe full name instead of the shortcut
